  this script calculates the dose rates at 0.1, 1 and 10 km coming from SMR 
  the details and used correlations can be found in the "./rad_impact/presentation_rad_imp.pdf"
  
  
  this script calculates the dose rates at 0.1, 1 and 10 km from SMR core leak
  the script will be modified to determine the evacuation zone to limit the dose rate to 20 mSv, see "SMR cost estimate.pdf"

  to see the plum rise, Pasquille conditions and Gaussian distribution for different weather conditions, 
    run th "./rad_impact/plot.rb" script. The figures will be shown and after closure they will be saved to ".rad_impact/fig"
   
  to calculate the dose rates, run the "./rad_impact/rad_imp.rb" script, the dose equivalddnts will be shown and saved as above
